Welcome to the web page for _Mathematical and Computational Biology in Drug
Discovery_, the course series running at the Department of Mathematics and
Computer Science, University of Basel in the spring semester 2021.

The course is open to all students who wish to learn about principles and
techniques of mathematical and computational biology as well as their
applications in drug discovery.

## Preparation

To prepare for the course, please (1) check that you have acquired required
prior knowledge, (2) be aware that the lecture will take place virtually on
*Zoom*, (3) fill [the pre-course survey](https://forms.gle/Eqyb75V2JNZSH3qWA), and (4) make sure that you
can commit enough time to the course.

First, you should be familiar with the content covered by the course series
[*Introduction to Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug Discovery*](https://www.amidd.ch) that run in fall semesters. Slides of that course are available in the link.

Second, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the MCBDD course in 2021 will take
place online with *Zoom*. The meeting link is shared with registered
participants via Email.

To make the course useful and valuable for you, I invite you to fill [the
pre-course survey](https://forms.gle/Eqyb75V2JNZSH3qWA). Your opinions help to
shape the course.

Finally, please note that the course on average requires about 4-6 hours' time
each week for reading assignments or programming tasks.

## Logistics

### Time

Lectures take place on Fridays between 12:15 and 14:00 on Zoom. See
[Syllabus](#syllabus) for the topics we plan to cover.

### Course material and licensing

Course material, including lecture notes, slides, and reading material, is
shared on the courseâ€™s web site, [https://www.MCBDD.ch](https://www.MCBDD.ch),
under the GNU General Public License v3.0 unless otherwise specified.

All Zoom sessions are recorded and distributed among attendees.

### Assessment

The final note is given by participation (60%) and project work (40%).

## Syllabus

We plan to cover the following topics. The topics and the order may change,
depending on the feedback of the students.

### Module Zero: The Survival tool kit

1. Reproducible computational research for drug discovery (05.03.2021)

### Module I: Introduction and human genomics for drug discovery

2. Architecture of the human genome (12.03.2021)
3. Evolution and variability of the human genome (19.03.2021)
4. Disease association and target hunting with genomics (26.03.2021)
5. *Ostern - no lecture* (02.04.2021)

### Module II: Gene expression and drug action

6. Gene expression regulation (09.04.2021)
7. Differential gene expression and functional analysis (16.04.2021)
8. Inference of drug MoA with gene expression (23.04.2021)
9. Single-cell analysis for disease understanding and target identification (30.04.2021)

### Module III: Drug modalities

10. Antisense oligonucleotides (16.04.2021)
11. *Auffahrt - no lecture* (14.05.2021)
12. Antibodies (21.05.2021)
13. Gene- and cell-therapy and other novel modalities (28.05.2021)
14. Guest lectures (04.06.2021)

We mainly discuss applications of following mathematical and computational
topics:

* Reproducible research tools, such as git, Snakemake/NextFlow, conda, etc.
* Linear models and generalised linear models
* Inference methods, such as the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, Hidden
  Markov Models (HMMs), clustering algorithms, and Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo.
* Generative models
* Gene network inference
* Deep learning and Gaussian Process
* Mathematical modelling
