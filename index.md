title: MCBDD 2021
---

Welcome to the web page for _Mathematical and Computational Biology in Drug
Discovery_, the course series running at the Department of Mathematics and
Computer Science, University of Basel in the spring semester 2021.

The course is open to all students who wish to learn about principles and
techniques of mathematical and computational biology as well as their
applications in drug discovery.

## Preparation

To prepare for the course, please (1) check that you have acquired required
prior knowledge, (2) make sure that you can commit enough time to the course,
(3) be aware that the lecture will take place virtually on *Zoom*, and (4) fill
[the pre-course survey](https://forms.gle/Eqyb75V2JNZSH3qWA).

You should foremost be familiar with the content covered by the course series
[*Introduction to Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug
Discovery*](https://www.amidd.ch) that run in fall semesters.

The MCBDD course on average requires about 4-6 hours' time each week for
reading assignments or programming tasks.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the MCBDD course in 2021 will take
place online with *Zoom*. The meeting link is shared with registered
participants via Email.

Finally, to make the course useful and valuable for you, I invite you to fill
[the pre-course survey](https://forms.gle/Eqyb75V2JNZSH3qWA). Your opinions help
to shape the course.


## Logistics

### Time

Lectures take place on Fridays between 12:15 and 14:00 on Zoom. See
[Syllabus](#syllabus) for the topics we plan to cover.

### Course material and licensing

Course material, including lecture notes, slides, and reading material, is
shared on the courseâ€™s web site, [https://www.MCBDD.ch](https://www.MCBDD.ch),
under the GNU General Public License v3.0 unless otherwise specified.

All Zoom sessions are recorded and distributed among attendees.

### Assessment

The final note is given by participation (60%) and project work (40%).

## Syllabus

We plan to cover the following topics. The topics and the order may change,
depending on the feedback of the students.

### Module Zero: The Survival tool kit

### Module I: Genomics for drug discovery

2. Architecture of the human genome (12.03.2021)
3. Evolution and variability of the human genome (19.03.2021)
4. Disease association and target hunting with genomics (26.03.2021)
5. *Ostern - no lecture* (02.04.2021)

### Module II: Gene expression and drug action

1. Gene expression regulation (09.04.2021)
2. Differential gene expression and functional analysis (16.04.2021)
3. Inference of drug MoA with gene expression (23.04.2021)
4. Single-cell analysis for disease understanding and target identification (30.04.2021)

### Module Intermezzo: Guest Lecture

10. Guest lectures by Dr. Petra Schwalie, Dr. Tony Kam-Thong, and Dr. Fabian
    Birzele. (07.05.2021)

### Module III: Drug modalities

11. *Auffahrt - no lecture* (14.05.2021)
12. Antisense oligonucleotides (21.05.2021)
13. Antibodies (28.05.2021)
14. Gene- and cell-therapy and other novel modalities (04.06.2021)

We mainly discuss applications of following mathematical and computational
topics:

* Reproducible research tools, such as git, Snakemake/NextFlow, conda, etc.
* Linear models and generalised linear models
* Inference methods, such as the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, Hidden
  Markov Models (HMMs), clustering algorithms, Monte-Carlo methods, and
  variational methods
* Generative models
* Gene network inference
* Machine learning, deep learning, and Gaussian Process
* Mathematical modelling
