Welcome to the web page for _Mathematical and Computational Biology in Drug
Discovery_, the course series running at the Department of Mathematics and
Computer Science, University of Basel in the spring semester 2021.

The course is open to all students who wish to learn about principles and
techniques of mathematical and computational biology as well as their
applications in drug discovery.

## Preparation

To prepare for the course, please (1) check that you have acquired required
prior knowledge, (2) be aware that the lecture will take place on Zoom, (3) fill
the pre-course survey (optional) and (4) make sure that you have to commit
enough time to the course.

First, you should be familiar with the content covered by the course series
[*Introduction to Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug Discovery*](https://www.amidd.ch) that run in fall semesters. Slides of that course are available in the link.

Second, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the MCBDD course in 2021 will take
place online with *Zoom*. The meeting link is shared with registered
participants via Email.

To make the course useful and valuable for you, I invite you to fill [the
pre-course survey](https://forms.gle/Eqyb75V2JNZSH3qWA). This is optional. I
strongly encourage you to do so though because your opinions help to shape the
course.

Finally please note that the course requires about 2-4 hours' time each week for
reading assignments or programming tasks.

## Logistics

### Time

Lectures takes place on Fridays between 12:15 and 14:00 on Zoom.

### Course material and licensing

Course material, including lecture notes, slides, and reading material, is
shared on the courseâ€™s web site, [https://www.MCBDD.ch](https://www.MCBDD.ch),
under the GNU General Public License v3.0 unless otherwise specified.

All Zoom sessions are recorded and distributed among attendees.

### Assessment

The final note is given by participation (60%) and project work (40%).
